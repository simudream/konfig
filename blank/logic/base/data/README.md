You may need to pass metadata to a logic script (e.g. metadata required for stamping files):

1. Create `data` subdirectory under each of your `logic` directory.

2. In there, create `.json` file containing your data. We recommend creating & naming the JSON file per category that makes sense to you.

For a complete example, take a look at `tests/project` directory.
