Logic is what you expect, it is the place where you performs installation or command or stamping files.

### To create a new logic

1. Create a subdirectory inside `logic` directory and give it the name of your logic.

2. Create a `__init__.py` file under your new logic subdirectory.

    * Make sure your new file inherits from base.

For a complete example, take a look at `tests/project` directory.
