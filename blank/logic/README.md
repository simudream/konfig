Logic is what you expect, it is the place where you performs installation or command.

### To create a new logic

* Create a new directory under `/logic`.

* Choose a language: Python or Ruby.

    * If you chose Python, create a `__init__.py` file under your new logic directory.

    * If you chose Ruby, create a ruby file, with the same name as your logic directory, under your new logic directory.

    * Make sure your new file inherits from base.

* Feel free to look at `users` logic as an example.
